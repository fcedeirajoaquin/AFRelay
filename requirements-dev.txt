# Requirements
# ------------
# Python 3.12 recommended; 3.14 has no pre-built wheels yet for
# pydantic-core (Rust extension). If you use 3.14+ you will need:
#   - Rust toolchain (cargo + rustc)
#   - C compiler
#   - maturin (auto-installed if missing)
# With 3.12 `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` in development 
# or `pip install -r requirements.txt` in production works out of the box.
